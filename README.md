# installdrupal

It's a simple script to download, extract drupal and set a default settings to let it ready to send to some folder to be installed. Not so useful if used alone, but can be associated with another script.

"You could use Drush", you say.
Well, I like to develop trough several development machines, with several sites from different projects each one, including Windows. The path trough the Drush development does not met this requiremente, so a simpler utility install drush is more suitable.
